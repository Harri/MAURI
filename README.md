# MAURI
Mother of Awesome User Registry Instances (AUR)

MAURI can create and delete AUR instances. AUR is an intentionally broken tool to list users.

## What?

MAURI and AUR were made for test automation purposes. In order to have exercises and demos in TA trainings you need to have a system to test. MAURI makes it easy for everyone to have their own system to play with and AUR is intentionally broken to make things more fun and interesting.
